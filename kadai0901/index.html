        <p>This is the first box. It has a light blue background, rounded corners, and a solid border. This box includes an image below to
            enhance the visual appeal of the content. The image should be relevant to the content described and help illustrate the point.

            <div class="box box2">
<h2>Box 02</h2>
<p>This is the second box. It has a light orange background, slightly rounded corners, a solid border, and a shadow. Including an
    image in this box helps break up the text and provides a visual example of the content. The use of CSS box shadow enhances the
    3D effect of this box.
